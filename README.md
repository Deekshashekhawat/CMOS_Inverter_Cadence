## Description
This project demonstrates the design and analysis of a CMOS inverter using Cadence Virtuoso. The transient response and power dissipation of the inverter were simulated and analyzed to understand its switching characteristics.

## Tools Used
- Cadence Virtuoso
- Simulation environment for transient analysis

## Implementation
1. Designed CMOS inverter schematic in Cadence Virtuoso.
2. Set up simulation parameters for transient response.
3. Ran simulations and obtained voltage transfer characteristics.
4. Calculated power dissipation during switching.
